# Search and Optimization: Genetic and Ant Colony Algorithms

## Overview

This repository demonstrates the application of **Genetic Algorithms (GA)** and **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)** for solving optimization problems. It includes documentation, configuration files, and a detailed notebook for understanding and implementing these algorithms.

## Files

- **`genetic_algorithm_routes.json`**  
  Contains configuration and route definitions for the Genetic Algorithm implementation.

- **`antcolony_algorithm_routes.json`**  
  Includes configuration and route details for the Ant Colony Optimization implementation.

- **`Genetic and ant colony Algorithm.pdf`**  
  A comprehensive PDF guide explaining the methodologies, algorithms, and their applications.

- **`Genetic and ant colony Algorithm.ipynb`**  
  A Jupyter Notebook illustrating the implementation of GA and ACO, with visualizations and examples.

- **`methodology_ga`**  
  Detailed methodology specific to the Genetic Algorithm.

- **`methodology_aco`**  
  Detailed methodology specific to the Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm.

- **`sub_data_file`**  
  A data file containing node coordinates (`x` and `y`) used in the optimization problems.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Notebook**  
   Open the Jupyter Notebook (`Genetic and ant colony Algorithm.ipynb`) to explore the implementations of GA and ACO.

2. **Configure Parameters**  
   Modify `genetic_algorithm_routes.json` and `antcolony_algorithm_routes.json` to customize routes and parameters.

3. **Analyze Methodologies**  
   Refer to `methodology_ga` and `methodology_aco` for insights into the algorithms' theoretical and practical aspects.

4. **Data Input**  
   Use `su_data_file` for node coordinates in optimization scenarios.
